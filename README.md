# CURSI

CURSI is an esoteric programming language based on reCURSIon and composition.
It comes with a very minimal set of basic functions that are composed to create more meaningful functions.

All the code to run CURSI is bundled in the standalone `cursi.html` file in this repository.
It provides you with an interactive CURSI environment right in your browser.
If you don't want to download the file and open it locally, you can also access a hosted copy here: https://loadingbyte.com/cursi.
Try it out!

## Example

The `cursi.html` file contains exhaustive documentation of the language.
What follows is some sample code extracted from the file.
The code provides the `±` function that computes the sign of a number.
